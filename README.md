#  Simple Electric Circuit (Unity 3D)

A beginner-friendly Unity 3D project that simulates a basic electric circuit with a **battery**, **bulb**, and **wire**.

##  Features
- Interactive 3D components: Battery, Bulb, and Wire  
- Adjustable resistance and light intensity  
- Realistic simulation of circuit behavior (Ohm’s Law simplified)  
- Optional upgrades:
  - UI slider to control voltage
  - Switch to turn the circuit on/off

## How to Run
1. Open the project in **Unity 2021 LTS or newer**.  
2. Open the scene: `Scenes/MainScene.unity`.  
3. Press **Play**  to run the simulation.  

##  Future Improvements
- Add circuit UI panel to display voltage/current  
- Implement multiple bulbs or resistors in parallel/series  
- Add educational explanations for each component
